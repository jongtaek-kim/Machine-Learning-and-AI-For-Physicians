## In Some Ways, Learning Program Language And Coding Is Like Learning A Foreign Language.
### You have to learn the vocabularies, syntax, and semantics.

## In this Python exercise, we will cover some of basic Python syntax and semantics to understand how a program is written. This will serve as a building block for understanding how ML algorithms run. 

## Excercise 1: Built In Functions
### Import a module (first line of program)
```bash
$ import math
```
&nbsp; 
### Use functions and constants from the module
```bash
$ print(math.sqrt(5))
$ print(math.pi)
```
&nbsp; 
### List everything in the module
```bash
$ print(dir(math))
```
&nbsp; 
### Import a single item 
```bash
$ from math import sqrt
$ print(sqrt(5))
```
&nbsp; 

### "input" function is already built in Python3
```bash
$ print(2*int(input("Enter a number:")))
```

## Excercise 2: Data Type
