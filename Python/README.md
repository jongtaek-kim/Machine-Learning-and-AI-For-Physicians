## In Some Ways, Learning Program Language And Coding Is Like Learning A Foreign Language.
### You have to learn the vocabularies, syntax, and semantics.

## In this Python exercise, we will cover some of basic Python syntax and semantics to understand how a program is written. This will serve as a building block for understanding how ML algorithms run. 

## Excercise 1: Built In Functions
### Import a module (first line of program)
```bash
$ import math
```
&nbsp; 
### Use functions and constants from the module
```bash
$ print(math.sqrt(5))
$ print(math.pi)
```
&nbsp; 
### List everything in the module
```bash
$ print(dir(math))
```![paint_room](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44178167/147625547-75c15174-f4ff-4b70-805f-b7ed1dd2aecc.png)

&nbsp; 
### Import a single item 
```bash
$ from math import sqrt
$ print(sqrt(5))
```
&nbsp; 

### "input" function is already built in Python3
```bash
$ print(2*int(input("Enter a number:")))
```
&nbsp; 

### List of Built-in Python Functions [Here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)

## Excercise 2: Data Type
### type() is another built-in function 
```bash
$ print(type(5))
$ print(type (5.0))
$ print(type("string"))
```
&nbsp; 
### An int is short for integer.
### A float is a number with a decimal place - very useful for representing things like weights or proportions.
### Strings are used in all modern programming languages to store and process textual information
###       


### What is wrong with this code?
```bash
$ print(Hello World)
```
&nbsp; 

### Correct way to print a string.
```bash
$ print("Hello World")
```
&nbsp; 


### True Division uses the slash (/) character as the operator sign. It always gives us a float.
```bash
$ print(10/3)
$ print(10.5/3.5)
$ print(11/3)
```
&nbsp; 

### Floor Division- The operator "//" performs floor division
```bash
$ print(9//3)
$ print(10//3)
$ print(11//3)
```
&nbsp; 

### What is the result from this code?
```bash
$ print(int(7.4))
```
&nbsp; 
### The function int forms an integer by cutting off all digits after the decimal point.


## Excercise 3: Python Variables
### A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
```bash
x = 5
y = "Elon"
print(x)
print(y)
```
&nbsp; 
### Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
```bash
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

## Problem: How many cans of paint do you need for a house with 20 rooms?

</p>

```bash
import math               # import a module        
small = 6 * 10            # area to paint for small wall  
big = 8 * 10              # area to paint for big wall
one = 2 *(big + small)    # area to paint for one room
all_rooms = 20 * one      # total area to paint
one_can_coverage = 5 * 350  # one can paint 5 walls, each wall has area of 350
cans = math.ceil(all_rooms / one_can_coverage)    # number of cans needed rounded up
print(cans)
```
&nbsp; 

## Excercise 4: Creating Functions In Python
### A function header specifies the names of the function and parameters.
### A function body is the code that determines the output.

</p>

### Python Function #1
```bash
def sub(first, second):
       return first - second

print(sub(10, 5))
```
&nbsp; 
### Python Function #2
```bash
def f(x, y, z):
       A = (x + y + z) ** 2 
       return A

print(f(1, 2, 3))
```
&nbsp; 
### Python Function #3: Calculating Parking Charges.
```bash
WEEK_CHARGE = 100
DAY_CHARGE = 20
DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7

def parking_fee(total_days):
    ## Determine number of weeks, days remaining
    weeks = total_days // DAYS_IN_WEEK
    days = total_days % DAYS_IN_WEEK
    
    ## Calculate cost of weeks, days remaining
    week_cost = weeks * WEEK_CHARGE
    day_cost = days * DAY_CHARGE
    
    ## TOTAL COST
    return week_cost + day_cost

print(parking_fee(31))
```
&nbsp; 

### Python Function #4: Calculating Parking Charges For Each Customer.
```bash
WEEK_CHARGE = 100
DAY_CHARGE = 20
DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7

def parking_fee(total_days):
    ## Determine number of weeks, days remaining print(int(7.4))
    weeks = total_days // DAYS_IN_WEEK
    days = total_days % DAYS_IN_WEEK
    
    ## Calculate cost of weeks, days remaining
    week_cost = weeks * WEEK_CHARGE
    day_cost = days * DAY_CHARGE
    
    ## TOTAL COST
    return week_cost + day_cost

print("You owe $",parking_fee(int(input("How many days did you park?:"))))
print("Cash or Credit Card Accepted")
```
