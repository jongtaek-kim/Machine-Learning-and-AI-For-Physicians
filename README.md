## 1. Introduction to Programming
### Many Programming Language Exists. Here are some popular and newer ones for machine learning.

### A) [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python ranks first in the latest annual ranking of popular programming languages. The increasing adoption of machine learning worldwide is a major factor contributing to its growing popularity. Python is relatively easy to learn, scalable and open source. Python has many awesome visualization packages and useful core libraries like Numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn which really makes your work very easy and empower the machines to learn.

### B) [R Programming Language](https://www.rstudio.com/):  R language can  be used by non-programmers including data miners, data analysts, and statisticians. R programming language is a fantastic choice when it comes to crunching large numbers and is the preferred choice for machine learning applications that use a lot of statistical data. With user-friendly IDE’s like RStudio and various tools to draw graphs and manage libraries – R is a must-have programming language in a machine learning engineer’s toolkit.

### C) [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/): Though Python and R continue to be the favourites of machine learning enthusiasts, Java is gaining popularity among machine learning engineers. Using Java for machine learning projects makes it easier for machine learning engineers to integrate with existing code repositories.

### D) [Julia](https://julialang.org/): Julia is a high-level programming language for computational science and numerical analysis. It comes with a large mathematical feature library, a parallel and distributed execution program, a sophisticated compiler, and numerical precision. Julia is intended to overcome the limitations of Python and other computational programming and data processing languages and applications.

### E) [Go](https://go.dev/): Go is an open source and C-style programming language supported by Google. Go is a perfect low-level language for developers who want to work in the area of systems programming. It has a lot of the same features as C and C++, but without the complicated syntax and steep learning curve.
